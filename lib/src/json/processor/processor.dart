// A generalized processor for JSON source which takes elements from a
// reader, then leaves the processing to user overridable methods.

import "../reader/reader.dart";
import "../sink/sink.dart";

/// A generalized JSON processor.
///
/// The processor traverses JSON-like data as provided by a [JsonReader].
/// It dispatches to individual `process` methods for each
/// kind of JSON value, but doesn't process the value
/// by default.
/// These methods can be overridden in subclasses to do something useful.
/// For example, the [JsonSinkProcessor] defaults to forwarding
/// each kind of JSON data to a [JsonSink].
///
/// The processor is similar to a [JsonSink]
/// in that there are methods for each kind of JSON data,
/// but instead of passing the JSON values to the individual `add` methods,
/// the `process` methods of the processsor takes a reader
/// which is ready to provide the value.
///
/// The process-method can either read the value, skip it,
/// or even read the source using [JsonReader.expectAnyValueSource]
/// and handle it itself.
///
/// Each process-method takes a `key` which is non-null when the
/// value is a JSON-object value. This allows the processor
/// to easily skip entire entries, perhaps even based on the
/// key name.
///
/// An example implementation of [processNum] could be:
/// ```dart
///   void processNum(JsonReader reader, String? key) {
///     if (key != null && key.startsWith("x-")) {
///       // Ignore key and value.
///       reader.skipAnyValue();
///     } else {
///       // Add key and value to a JsonSink.
///       if (key != null) sink.addKey(key);
///       sink.addNumber(reader.expectNum());
///     }
///   }
/// ```

  /// [processString], [processBool], [processArray]
  /// or [processObject] depending on what the next
  /// value of the reader is.
  /// If there is no value, or the reader has values
  /// which do not match a JSON type, the [processUnknown]
  /// method is called instead. This allows handling of
  /// unknown values in readers supporting that.
